# Project Overview

Welcome to the Medical Lock Hospitals Data Explorer. This app supports historical analysis of colonial medicalization with a focus on the lock hospital system in British India and British Burma.

## Research Questions

- How did the colonial state medicalize sexuality and transform women's bodies into administrative categories?
- How did legal frameworks (e.g., Contagious Diseases Acts) structure surveillance and punishment?
- What is the relationship between military health (VD admissions) and women’s registration flows?

## Data Sources

- Colonial Medical Annual Lock Hospital Reports (multiple presidencies and divisions)
- Digitized archives (e.g., NLS India Papers) — see `documents` table for links
- Extracted tables: `women_admission`, `troops`, `hospital_operations`, `stations`, `station_reports`, `hospital_notes`

## Methods (Brief)

- Ingest and standardization of historical tables into SQLite
- Harmonization of station names and geocoding
- Quantitative analysis (temporal, geographic, legal regime, military-medical nexus)
- Visualization (time series, bar charts, maps)

## Using this App

- Medicalization: KPIs and charts summarizing surveillance, acts, and punitive measures
- Hospital Operations: Filterable table with export
- Data Tables: Browse and edit (persists to SQLite)
- Visualizations: Interactive charts and map

## How to Update This Page

- Edit this file: `content/overview.md` (Markdown)
- Add images to `content/images/` — they will appear below automatically

## Key Terms (Short)

- CD Acts: Contagious Diseases Acts (e.g., Act XXII of 1864, Act XIV of 1868, Act III of 1880)
