COLONIAL MEDICALIZATION ANALYSIS
How did the colonial state medicalize sexuality and transform women's bodies into administrative categories?

This analysis explores the transformation of women's bodies into bureaucratic data through:
1. Quantification of surveillance
2. Geographic distribution of control
3. Temporal patterns of medicalization
4. Military-medical nexus
5. Administrative categorization systems

The data reveals a sophisticated bureaucratic apparatus that transformed women's 
bodies into administrative categories through:

‚Ä¢ QUANTIFICATION: Every aspect of women's bodies tracked, measured, categorized
‚Ä¢ MEDICALIZATION: Sexual health redefined as state concern via disease categories
‚Ä¢ SURVEILLANCE: Regular inspections, registration, tracking of movements
‚Ä¢ PUNISHMENT: Legal penalties for non-compliance (fines, imprisonment)
‚Ä¢ MILITARIZATION: System justified by military health needs
‚Ä¢ DOCUMENTATION: Extensive paper trails converting bodies into data points

This is not just healthcare - it's the colonial state's power to define, categorize,
monitor, and control women's sexuality through medical-legal-administrative means.
The archive itself IS the mechanism of control.
