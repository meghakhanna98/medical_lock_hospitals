# Medical Lock Hospitals Data Explorer

A comprehensive Shiny web application for exploring, cleaning, and analyzing historical medical lock hospital data from British India.

## Overview

This application provides an interactive interface to work with the `medical_lock_hospitals.db` SQLite database, which contains historical data about medical lock hospitals from the late 19th century British India. The database includes information about women's admissions, troop data, hospital operations, and station reports.

### Keys and Joins

- documents joined by doc_id to: hospital_operations, hospital_notes, women_admission, troops, station_reports
- stations joined by station_id to: station_reports; joined by name (TEXT) to: hospital_operations, women_admission, troops
- hospital_operations joined to hospital_notes by hid

Tip: Prefer station_id joins via station_reports for document-station relationships when possible; name-based joins are convenient but sensitive to spelling.

### Controlled Vocabularies and Values

- act (hospital_operations.act)
   - Act XXII of 1864, Act XIV of 1868, Act III of 1880, Act XII of 1864, Voluntary System
- inspection_freq (hospital_notes)
   - weekly, monthly, fortnightly, daily, regular, irregular
- unlicensed_control_type (hospital_notes)
   - police_action, special_constables, other
- committee_supervision (hospital_notes)
   - magistrate_oversight, committee, subcommittee_regular, subcommittee_irregular

### Standardizations and Naming Rules (Applied in October 2025)

- ‚ÄúIndia (British Burma)‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndia (British Burma)+G143‚Äù ‚Üí standardized to Rangoon
   - Duplicated station rows consolidated into a single canonical ‚ÄúRangoon‚Äù; dependent rows in station_reports repointed
- ‚ÄúSeetabuldee‚Äù and ‚ÄúSitabaldi‚Äù unified to ‚ÄúSitabaldi (Nagpur)‚Äù with coordinates set
- Coordinates added/updated (WGS84) for: Tonghoo (18.9398, 96.4344), Jubbulpore (23.1686, 79.9339), Muttra (27.4924, 77.6737), Umballa (30.3752, 76.7821), Meean Meer (31.5484, 74.3602), Fyzabad (26.7730, 82.1458), Mooltan (30.1979793, 71.4724978)

All changes were scripted with backups to archive/backups/ and are reflected in the live SQLite database.

### Geospatial Conventions

- Coordinates: decimal degrees, WGS84
- Missing coordinates are left NULL (NA in R)
- When multiple historical spellings exist, we standardize to one canonical station name and preserve the mapping in ingest scripts

### Interpretation Notes

- ‚Äúavg_registered‚Äù in women_admission is a source-derived average (often monthly) and may be used as a proxy for surveillance intensity; it is not an instantaneous headcount
- ‚Äúnon_attendance_cases‚Äù, ‚Äúfined_count‚Äù, and ‚Äúimprisonment_count‚Äù document the coercive apparatus around registration and inspection
- Troop disease measures and women registration flows can be compared at the station-year level to analyze the military-medical nexus

## Customization

### Adding New Visualizations
The app is designed to be easily extensible. To add new visualizations:

1. Add a new tab panel in the UI
2. Create corresponding server logic
3. Add database queries as needed

### Database Modifications
If you modify the database schema:

1. Update the table selection dropdowns
2. Modify the data quality checks
3. Update the visualization queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Database file not found"**
- Ensure `medical_lock_hospitals.db` is in the same directory as `app.R`
- Run `python3 create_database.py` to create the database

**Package installation errors**
- Update R to the latest version
- Install packages individually if batch installation fails
- Check for system dependencies (especially on Linux)

**App won't start**
- Check that all required packages are installed
- Verify R version compatibility
- Check console for error messages

### Performance Tips

- For large datasets, consider adding pagination limits
- Use database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement caching for expensive operations

## Data Sources

The application works with historical data from:
- Colonial Medical Annual Lock Hospital Reports
- British India administrative records
- Military and civilian hospital operations data
